UDP :

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is a communication protocol used to send and receive data over networks.

UDP is a lightweight and simple protocol that does not have the same reliability features as TCP. 
It does not ensure that data packets are delivered in order or without errors, but it is faster and more efficient than TCP.

UDP is commonly used for applications that require real-time or low-latency data transmission, such as online gaming, video streaming, and VoIP (voice over IP) calls. It is also used for some types of network discovery and broadcasting.


RUDP :

Reliable UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is an extension of the standard UDP protocol that adds reliability features similar to those found in TCP.

Reliable UDP uses techniques such as sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and retransmissions to ensure that data packets are delivered in order and without errors.

The advantage of reliable UDP over TCP is that it is faster and more efficient, with lower latency and less overhead. It is often used for applications that require high-speed,
low-latency data transfer, such as online gaming and video streaming.

Reliable UDP is sometimes also called "TCP-friendly UDP" because it provides many of the same reliability features as TCP while still using the UDP protocol.


UDP - Features :

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that provides a simple way to transmit data over networks. Its key features include:

    Low overhead: UDP has a small header that adds minimal overhead to the data being transmitted, which makes it fast and efficient.

    Connectionless: UDP does not establish a connection before transmitting data, which makes it simple and lightweight.

    Unreliable: UDP does not guarantee that data will be delivered in order, without errors, or without duplication. It is up to the application to ensure that the data is transmitted reliably.

    Low latency: UDP is designed to provide low latency, which makes it ideal for real-time applications like video conferencing and online gaming.

    Multicast support: UDP supports multicast, which allows a single packet to be transmitted to multiple receivers at the same time.

    No congestion control: UDP does not have built-in congestion control mechanisms, which means that it can potentially overwhelm the network with too much traffic.

Overall, UDP is a simple and lightweight protocol that is suitable for applications that require low latency and can tolerate some degree of data loss or errors. It is commonly used for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP (Voice over IP).
