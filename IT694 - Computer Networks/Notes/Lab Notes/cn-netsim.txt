Routing is the process of path selection in any network

Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a
packet on an IP network from source to destination

A hop occurs when a packet is passed from one network segment to the next.

Time to live (TTL) refers to the amount of time or “hops” that a packet is set to exist inside a 
network before being discarded by a router
